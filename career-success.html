"I love my work and felt the necessity to refocus myself and take time to reflect on my skills, weaknesses and achievements in my current role. I took the opportunity while I have a rewarding and pleasant job to completely redo my resume.

I had no hesitation hiring Careers by Design. I liked the fact that you were experienced, flexible, centrally located and had coaches that worked in the same industry as me.

Coaching helped me to ask questions about the industry I am in in terms of responsibilities I want to explore. It reaffirmed that I chose an industry where I can flourish and contribute in a variety of ways. Coaching helped me built a powerful and meaningful resume using the PAR method which takes time so I am glad I was in a position to work on it without the stress of being unemployed. I am very grateful for the advice I got from Lee and I am very proud of my new refreshed resume."

Coaching also gave me the opportunity to explore additional options to include in my life in terms of other interests I have that are not related to my current field.

Thank you Careers by Design! I now feel refreshed and exhilarated when I think about the future."</td>

"I have successfully owned, managed and operated my own business for nearly 19 years. Things began to change and my business was being negatively impacted in a slowly dying industry.

This shook my confidence and left me directionless. I knew I needed to make a change but I was feeling stuck.I had always been successful by being true to myself. I needed to do something different, something that was “me” but I didn’t know what that was.

Participating in The More Happy Mondays career coaching program at Careers by Design gave me the tools to feel more positive and handle this stressful situation better. All this boosted my confidence so I could take the next steps to get out of a difficult situation. My coach helped me to explore my options and I decided on a new direction with confidence.

Learning more about myself helped me to leverage my skills and experiences and use them to start a new venture that is off to a strong start. 

I highly recommend Careers by Design to anyone who wants to start feeling better now and have a career that really fits who they are."

"It felt like finding a job was a monolithic task before the coaching began.

I really appreciated starting the process by looking at what was important to me and using the exercise as an opportunity to achieve congruence between what is important to me and my working life. And also, having someone support these choices was very valuable.

Lee has a marvellous knack of connecting the dots and offering an alternative way of approaching the task. I liked the fact that Lee brought a fresh perspective to an issue and shared her insights about why something worked or didn't."</td>

"Before the Turning Point session, I was stressed, negative, not confident and didn't know where I was going in my career.

Coaching with Careers by Design helped me achieve the confidence and self-worth I always had but never was able to realize before.

I came out of this a stronger, more confident and relaxed individual than I was just several months ago.

Coaching is unbiased. It is where someone listens and guides you based on the problems or dilemmas you have. I have gone to friends and colleagues looking for answers and realized that wasn't the right way to do things. It was confusing and they guided you into a direction you weren't suited for or comfortable in. I am glad I went for coaching."

The HeartMath tools helped me immensely. Can I rate it as 100 (out of 10)! I will continue to use them throughout my career progression."</td>
